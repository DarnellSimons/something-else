              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Ground was broken for the Bahrain International Circuit in December 2002. Like the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, the developers had a blank, sandy canvas to work with, and with that
                fashioned the technical, 5.4km track designed by Hermann Tilke.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                It was 2004 when the drivers first lined up under an unusually cloudy sky for the inaugural Bahrain Grand Prix. The race was dominated (like many in 2004) by the two Ferraris, with
                Michael Schumacher winning out from Rubens Barrichello, while the crowds were also treated to a fantastic dog-fight between the Jaguar of Mark Webber and the Renault of Fernando
                Alonso.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                You can usually expect great racing and decent amounts of overtaking in Bahrain, while the drivers have to contend with wind, racing under floodlights and the difficulty of finding a
                decent set-up with the wide temperature fluctuations between sessions. The track’s most challenging point is the tight, downhill, off-camber Turn 10 left-hander, while the fast run
                through Turn 12 is another highlight, allowing the racers to really feel their cars coming alive.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Given the nature of the track, race-goers in Bahrain have always got a decent chance of being treated to a 'duel in the desert' or three. Away from the race track, Bahrain, as you
                might expect, is a great place to catch some rays, with the 33-island archipelago kingdom featuring some jaw-dropping resorts. And if you want to do some racing yourself, the Bahrain
                International Karting Circuit, located right next to the track, is one of the world’s top karting facilities.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Your options are slightly limited in Bahrain, given that the organisers understandably don’t want loads of fans having to traipse out into the middle of a hot desert to watch the
                action! We reckon your best bet is to get a place in the Batelco grandstand, giving you a great view of cars charging into Turn 8, hammering through 9 and 10 and then passing you on
                the run down to the short-apex Turn 11. Otherwise, the grandstand on the outside of Turns 1 and 2 will allow you to watch overtaking aplenty on either track layout.

              <div class="answer">
                The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is, you won’t be surprised to hear, a temporary street circuit (albeit adorned with some permanent sections), located on the Corniche – a 30km coastal
                resort area of the ancient Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Designed by the Tilke company, in conjunction with Formula 1’s own Motorsports team – who used Google Earth for their initial
                investigations into potential layouts – F1’s Ross Brawn said of the track: “What we want to see is a race circuit. We don’t want Mickey Mouse circuits. We don’t want those old classic
                street circuits with 90 degree turns. We want fast sweeping circuits, circuits which are going to challenge the drivers – and they are going to love it.”

              <div class="answer">
                Fast. Very fast. Average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are around 250km/h – quicker than those at Silverstone, and second on the 2021 calendar only to Monza – aka ‘The
                Temple of Speed’. It is, quite simply, the fastest street circuit ever seen in Formula 1 – while the track also features the most corners on the calendar with 27, many of them quick,
                sinuous bends as the drivers wend their way along the Jeddah waterfront.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix promises a sun-soaked festival of Formula 1, located on an idyllic stretch of the Kingdom’s coastline. The on-track action is stunning, as the drivers get
                to grips with this rapid street track, while Jeddah itself comes alive as the city revels in hosting the F1 circus.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are such that any grandstand provides a spectacular viewing location. Nonetheless, the gladiatorial splendour of the grandstand
                surrounding the banked Turn 13 corner makes for a very special spot for F1 fans.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The deal to host Formula 1 in Melbourne was done in 1993, with the decision taken to create a circuit using a mixture of the existing roads around the city’s Albert Park – mainly
                Aughtie Drive and Lakeside Drive if you fancy driving it yourself – with a little detour through the Lakeside Stadium’s car park.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Just four months after Adelaide held its last Australian Grand Prix at the end of 1995, the Formula 1 teams were back in Australia for Melbourne's first Grand Prix at the start of
                1996. That race is most often remembered for Martin Brundle’s infamous Jordan crash at Turn 3 after he launched himself off the back of Johnny Herbert’s Sauber.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                As a temporary facility, Albert Park can be quite bumpy, while the circuit at the start of the weekend is often slippery, rubbering in as the sessions progress. It’s also a circuit
                that requires a well-sorted chassis, with several spots on the track where the drivers require a reactive front end to allow them to chuck it into a corner. Melbourne is also one of
                the faster tracks on the calendar, with Max Verstappen’s 2023 pole lap set at an average of over 250km/h.

              <div class="answer">
                Often found on lists of the world’s best cities, Melbourne is a blast all year round – and it only gets better when Formula 1 rolls into town. There are bars and restaurants aplenty,
                you’re right by the beach, while the race’s appearance at the start of Australia’s autumn means the temperatures should be peachy.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                If you want to get in a grandstand, opt for either the Waite stand overlooking Turn 10, or the Brabham Grandstand on the outside of Turn 2 to watch cars jostling for position through
                the first chicane. Alternatively, there are some nice general admission spots on the far side of the lake – go for either between Turns 8-9 or 9-10 if you fancy some F1 picnic feels.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In 1962. Soichiro Honda, whose car company you may have heard of, was a man with big ambitions. Seeking to turn Honda into an automotive powerhouse, he decided his company should have
                its own test track. Dutchman John Hugenholtz got the nod, and drew up the now-iconic ‘crossover’ Suzuka track – although original drawings saw the track pass over and under itself a
                full three times, which would have been sweet!
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Despite most people agreeing that Suzuka is a worthy successor to sliced bread in the ‘Best Thing’ stakes, the Japanese track was a relative latecomer to the F1 calendar, making its
                first appearance in 1987. Nigel Mansell would remember that weekend well, after he suffered a crash in qualifying that ruled him out of the race, gifting that year’s championship to
                his bitter rival Nelson Piquet.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Show us a racing a driver who doesn’t love Suzuka, and we’ll show you a liar. The high-speed track remains one of the ultimate driving challenges, with the snaking ‘S’ Curves, the two
                commitment-rewarding Degners and the white-knuckle ride of 130R all highlights in a series of highlights at what is one of F1’s seminal tracks. And hey, it’s got a crossover, which is
                always cool, right?
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A track that has witnessed an unfair share of legendary F1 moments (not least between Messrs Prost and Senna), a unique set of fans with an unabashed commitment to playing Formula 1
                dress-up, a Ferris wheel, and great food. Okay, for most of us it’s a long slog to get there, but surely a better question is: ‘Why not go?’
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Take your pick. Grandstands D and E overlook the ‘S’ Curves, giving you an amazing chance to watch downforce and commitment working in perfect harmony as the drivers negotiate the
                sinuous turns. Elsewhere, the left flank of Grandstand G places you at the inside of 130R, which should be a bit of a treat, while if it’s overtaking you want, Grandstand I will give
                you a view of the incident-attracting Hairpin.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In April 2003, a marshland in the Jiading District of Shanghai was earmarked for Formula 1 greatness. Eighteen months and around $450 million later, the state-of-the-art Shanghai
                International Circuit was complete.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The 2004 season featured two new races, one of which was the Chinese Grand Prix (the other was Bahrain). If either were added to try and stop Ferrari from winning everything, however,
                it didn’t work – Michael Schumacher won in Bahrain, while Rubens Barrichello triumphed in China.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The circuit’s pleasing form when seen from the air – it’s designed to look like the Chinese symbol for ‘shang’, meaning upwards – is equally pleasing to the drivers on terra firma.
                There’s a unique start to the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and 4. The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by
                the drivers, while the circuit also features one of the longest straights on the calendar, the 1.2km stretch that separates Turns 13-14.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Shanghai has expanded itself into one of the world’s most dynamic and lively cities since the start of the millennium, making it an awesome F1 tourist stop. The sprawling Pudong
                district is chock full of hip bars and amazing restaurants. Then when it’s time to go racing, just hop on the Shanghai Metro’s Line 11 and get off at the Shanghai Circuit stop 60
                minutes later.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                We’re going to recommend Grandstand K, overlooking the Turn 14-15 hairpin, where you’ll be in the best seats to watch all the overtaking. Alternatively, head for Turn 6, the track’s
                other best passing spot, where Daniel Ricciardo sealed his 2018 win with a brave move on Valtteri Bottas.

                Having made its F1 debut in May 2022, the Miami International Autodrome is a temporary circuit, but one designed to have a permanent feel. Set in the Hard Rock Stadium complex in Miami
                Gardens, home to the NFL’s famous Miami Dolphins franchise, the track is the culmination of a development process that simulated no less than 36 different layouts before settling on a
                thrilling, 19-turn lap that provides a street circuit vibe, not dissimilar to Melbourne’s Albert Park.

                are elevation changes too, the main one found between Turns 13 and 16, with the track heading over an exit ramp and under various flyovers across uneven ground. The Turn 14-15 chicane,
                meanwhile, has an uphill approach, with a crest in the middle, and then drops down on exit.

              <div class="answer">
                The Hard Rock Stadium knows how to put on a show – it has hosted six Super Bowls, two Baseball World Series and numerous rock concerts. Put it at the heart of a track designed to
                encourage close racing while meeting the highest safety standards and you have a sure-fire winner for spectators. Then there’s Miami itself – famed for its sandy beaches, art deco
                vibe, vibrant multiculturalism and rich sporting heritage, it’s an essential destination for those visiting the Sunshine State.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                When viewing a sporting event in a purpose-built stadium, it’s hard to go wrong. In fact, you could walk around the top deck of the Hard Rock Stadium and see every corner of the track
                – pretty unique. As for the best passing spots, a seat near Turns 1, 11 or 17 should put you in the thick of the action.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Imola – or the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari as it’s been known since 1988 – had its foundation stone laid in March 1950. It was ready for testing by October 1952, while
                racing began at the circuit in 1953.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Imola first hosted a non-championship F1 race in 1963, but it would take some politicking with Monza in 1980 before the track was awarded the honour of hosting the Italian Grand Prix
                for the first time that year. From 1981, the two tracks worked together in perfect harmony, with Imola taking on its famous ‘San Marino’ title, and going on to host a total of 27
                Grands Prix up until 2006. It returned as venue for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in 2020.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A thrill ride. After testing his AlphaTauri AT01 at the track in the build-up to the 2020 season, Pierre Gasly called the experience one of the best he’d ever had in a Formula 1 car,
                while his then-team mate Daniil Kvyat remarked that “an F1 car through corners like Acque Minerali – the entrance is so fast, it’s so cool. It really gives you a lot of adrenaline.”
                The anti-clockwise circuit is certainly fast, with an old-school feel as the drivers put it on the line in iconic corners like the aforementioned Acque Minerali and Piratella.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Like neighbouring Mugello, Imola is nestled in a fantastic part of the world, with the Tuscan hills to the south, the Adriatic beaches to the east and the gastronomic delights of
                cities like Bologna, Parma and Modena to the west – as well as the F1 mecca that is Ferrari’s HQ in nearby Maranello. There’s also no getting around the fact that a visit to Imola is
                an opportunity for F1 fans to pay their respects to Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, who lost their lives at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The stand on the outside of Acque Minerali is a great spot to see an F1 machine being pushed to its absolute limits, as the drivers struggle to get the cars down to speed for the tight
                right-hander before blasting back up the hill to the Variante Alta chicane.

              <div class="answer">
                It was 1929 when racing engines first reverberated around the Principality, after cigarette manufacturer Antony Noghes decided to organise a race with his pals from the Automobile Club
                de Monaco. The race was part of the calendar in the first year of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, and hasn’t been off it since 1955.

              <div class="answer">
                Incredibly narrow and totally iconic. Nelson Piquet memorably described driving around Monaco as “like riding a bicycle around your living room”… which is fair. Despite that, it’s a
                challenge that nearly all drivers love, forcing them to put their skills on the line and rewarding millimetric accuracy. Overtaking on the tight streets is harder, however, with the
                2003 Grand Prix witnessing a grand total of zero passing moves!
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A holiday on the French Riviera, plus the chance to watch Formula 1 cars pounding past places where Monegasques usually go to buy a pint of milk? It really is as fun as it sounds. On
                top of that, the chance to walk the track after a day’s hard lapping – or even enjoy your dinner on it at one of the terrasse bars – is not to be missed.

                Assuming you can’t get into one of the overhanging apartment blocks around the circuit (or onto a boat) shoot for anything from Grandstands L to P, which are clustered around the
                Swimming Pool section of the track, and where drivers hurl their cars through the tight chicane at 200km/h. Or, for a more spectacular vista, try Grandstand B, overlooking the ritzy

              <div class="answer">
                The man-made Notre Dame Island in the middle of the St Lawrence River was created for the 1967 Expo 67 World's Fair. Once the expo and the ensuing 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics had
                left town, some clever people decided to make a race track out of the island’s roads. And lo, the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame, as it then was, came to be.

              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                With the Canadian Grand Prix having been in search of a permanent home for a number of years in the 1960s and 1970s, the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame first hosted the race in 1978.
                Fittingly, Gilles Villeneuve claimed his maiden win, at the track that would end up bearing his name.

              <div class="answer">
                The fast, low-downforce circuit is one of the drivers’ favourites. The track is quite stop-start, with lots of heavy-braking chicanes and the famous hairpin to get the anchors working
                hard. Out of the corners, though, the track is quick and flowing, while the most iconic piece of the circuit comes right at the end of the lap: the Wall of Champions, so-called after
                excursions into it from Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher during the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix weekend.

                The Montrealais really embrace their Grand Prix weekend, with the charming city turning into an F1-loving party town in the week leading up to the race. For the Grand Prix itself, the
                leafy setting makes the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve one of Formula 1’s most laidback venues.

                It’s got to be one of either Grandstand 15, 21 or 24, the three that surround the hairpin. It makes for a real amphitheatre vibe down there, as well as allowing you to see all the
                hairpin overtakes.

              <div class="answer">
                The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built as part of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics development programme. The foundation stone was laid in 1989, while the first car race was a round
                of the 1991 Spanish Touring Car Championship.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Two weeks after the touring cars raced at Barcelona, it was Formula 1’s turn. The track enjoyed a sensational debut, with Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna’s famous eyeball-to-eyeball
                drag race down the straight, before Mansell took the lead and drove on to victory.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The drivers love the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which is just as well, as they have traditionally spent huge amounts of time pounding around it during winter testing. The track is
                a good mix of high- and low-speed corners, with the challenging Turn 3 right-hander a great chance to evaluate the balance of the car your team’s designers have given you to fight with
                for the season.
              </div>

                You don’t need us to tell you that Barcelona is one of the world’s great cities, even if we just sort of did. Food, culture, beaches – it’s all there, making a Spanish Grand Prix
                holiday a properly attractive proposition.

              <div class="answer">
                You’ve got plenty of choice, with almost the whole track overlooked by grandstands or general admission areas. On the outside of Turn 1, Grandstand A will let you see the best
                overtaking spot on the track, while the general admission area around Turn 3 will provide the awe-inspiring sight of Formula 1 cars being pushed to the limit of their downforce
                capabilities.

              <div class="answer">
                The fearsome, original Osterreichring was originated in 1969 as a replacement for the Zeltweg airfield circuit. The track known today as the Red Bull Ring was more or less created over
                the winter of 1995-6, when Hermann Tilke was engaged to turn the Osterreichring into a shorter, more modern race track.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The A1-Ring, as it was then called, was opened in 1996, with Formula 1 arriving at the circuit a year later. Jacques Villeneuve won the race, while Jean Alesi had a spectacular crash
                when his Benetton climbed up the Ferrari of Eddie Irvine. Alesi’s team mate Gerhard Berger, meanwhile, used his home Grand Prix to announce his F1 retirement.

              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                It’s only wee, bless it, but the Red Bull Ring packs a lot into a short lap. The first half rewards power, as the cars blast along three straights separated by a pair of uphill
                right-handers. But then as the drivers work their way downhill, the circuit becomes a regular toboggan ride, as the cars canyon through a series of quick corners, including the
                exhilarating Rindt right-hander, named for Austria’s first F1 champion.
              </div>

              <div class="answer">
                Race tracks don’t come much more picturesque than the Red Bull Ring, set in an idyllic natural bowl in the Styrian mountains. That makes for a pleasant environment for a Grand Prix,
                while if you’re after tourist attractions to visit after the race, look no further than the museum in Graz dedicated to the city’s favourite son: Arnold Schwarzenegger.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                One of Formula 1’s best views is to be had at the Red Bull Ring’s ‘Nord’ grandstand, based around the outside of what used to be the Bosch Kurve at the Osterreichring. Here, you’ll
                have a great vantage point across much of the track as it drops away from you down the natural slope of the circuit.

                Little did those laying the perimeter road to the RAF Silverstone airfield in 1942 know that they were setting down what would become one of the world’s greatest race tracks. But,
                well, they were! The Silverstone circuit was first used for a proper motor race in 1947 – although sadly, a local sheep lost its life during the proceedings…

              <div class="answer">
                Silverstone was the first Grand Prix, hosting the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship round on May 13 1950. Old campaigner Giuseppe Farina, who’d take that year’s title, won the
                race in his Alfa Romeo 158.

                At the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton compared a flat-out lap around Silverstone to flying a fighter jet, which should tell you all you need to know about the Northamptonshire
                circuit. Despite numerous layout changes over the years, Silverstone has always maintained its essential character as one of the fastest tracks on the F1 calendar, while historic
                corners like Maggotts, Becketts and Abbey provide some of the biggest challenges for racing drivers anywhere in the world.

                It’s hard to stop the goose bumps from prickling as you walk around one of the great cathedrals of motorsport, while in terms of atmosphere, the British fans are always reliably
                raucous – this is the country that invented football (that’s soccer, mind), after all.

              <div class="answer">
                The Becketts grandstand has to rank highly on the ultimate list of places to watch an F1 car in action – believe us, your eyes will be on stalks when you see how quickly the drivers
                zip through Maggotts and Becketts. Further along the track, the Stowe grandstands will place you at one of the best overtaking spots, while watching the drivers chuck their cars into
                that corner on their own is nearly as good.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Work began on the Hungaroring in 1985, and the track was race-ready just nine months later. The Hungarian government had originally considered reviving the old Nepliget park circuit in
                Budapest in a bid to host Formula 1 in the country, but in the end decided to create a purpose-built facility instead.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The year was 1986. Nelson Piquet won the first F1 race around the Hungaroring, famously slithering his Williams around the outside of Ayrton Senna’s Lotus to take the lead.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The lack of straights at the Hungaroring often sees it compared to a karting circuit – and it’s true, the resemblance is uncanny. With several series of corners to string together,
                teams opt for Monaco levels of downforce, with a well-sorted chassis tending to be rewarded over horsepower given the short straights on offer. It’s a challenge many of the drivers
                relish, however, with finding a good rhythm key to setting fast lap times.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Hungary in July is usually hot hot hot. The good news if you’re at the track, though, is that there’s a water park close by – the Mogyorodi Aquarena vizi szorakoztatopark – which
                should be a good place to cool off. Away from aqueous activities, the circuit is only 20km from Budapest, putting you close to one of Europe’s most fascinating, storied and lively city
                centres.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The track is built in a natural bowl, a bit like the UK's Brands Hatch. That means that any of the grandstands located on or around the main straight should provide a view of other
                parts of the track too, giving you more F1 bang for your, er, forint.

              <div class="answer">
                The original, triangle-shaped track was built in 1921, with designers Jules de Thier and Henri Langlois van Ophem using public roads between the towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and
                Stavelot to create an amazing 14.9km circuit taking in the forests and rolling hills of the beautiful Ardennes region. The track was redeveloped in 1979, and although the new circuit
                is only half the original's length, it’s still the longest on the current calendar at 7.004km.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Having hosted a non-championship Grand Prix as long ago as 1924, Belgium’s iconic circuit was one of just seven to be part of Formula 1’s maiden championship in 1950. That race was won
                by the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio, who led home an Alfa Romeo one-two ahead of team mate Nino Farina.

                Spa is among Formula 1 drivers’ most loved tracks, with its mix of long straights and challenging fast corners allowing them to push their cars to the edge of their capabilities – if
                it’s dry, that is. The size of the track and the nature of Belgian weather means it can sometimes be raining on one part of the track and dry on another, meaning grip can vary from one
                corner to the next. Keep an eye on the thrilling Eau Rouge, arguably the most famous sequence of corners in the world, as the drivers flick left, right and then up the hill through
                Raidillon.

                The elevated grandstand located near Eau Rouge gives you the best view of the iconic corner, while also boasting panoramic views from La Source through to Raidillon. But if you fancy
                taking in some of the best trackside atmosphere, then the grandstand located on the Pouhon corner should be right up your street.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Like Silverstone, Zandvoort was first opened in 1948, part of the wave of post-war motorsport enthusiasm that swept across Europe. Originally made up of a mixture of permanent track
                and public roads that snaked through the sand dunes of the Zandvoort resort town, the Dutch Automobile Racing Club – who initiated the plans for the circuit – brought in 1927 Le Mans
                winner Sammy Davis to consult on the layout for the original 4.2km track.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Formula 1 arrived in the Dutch dunes in 1952, with Alberto Ascari dominating the race as he led home a 1-2-3 for Ferrari. Formula 1 would go on to race on and off at the track until
                1985 – before, in 2019, the announcement came that the championship would return to Zandvoort for 2020, after a 35-year hiatus. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that became 36 years and a
                2021 date.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                ‘Really quick’, ‘pretty insane’, ‘crazy’ and ‘old-school’ were words used by the current crop of F1 drivers when asked to describe the Zandvoort track that many of them tackled in
                their junior category days. We’d also add ‘undulating’ to that list. The Zandvoort track swoops and flows through the sand dunes, creating a rollercoaster-like feel to the lap. And
                while the circuit was modernised in time for F1’s most recent return – including increasing the banking angle at the famous Tarzan corner to an Indianapolis Motor Speedway-trumping 18
                degrees – Zandvoort remains a proper, challenging drivers’ track.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Zandvoort combines a lot of enticing features for an F1 fan. There’s the historic track, which famously featured in John Frankenheimer’s Grand Prix, and was the scene of many great F1
                moments over the years (Gilles Villeneuve’s three-wheeled lap, anyone?). There’s the atmosphere, which with Max Verstappen on the grid is always guaranteed to be electric, and most
                definitely orange-hued. And then there’s the beachside location, just a 30-minute train ride outside of Amsterdam. What’s not to love?

              <div class="answer">
                We recommend taking to either the first turn at Tarzan, or to one of the banked corners, either at Arie Luyendijkbocht – the final turn on the track – or Hugenholtzbocht. For F1’s 2021
                return, the latter corner was both widened and banked into a parabolic corner, to allow cars to run side by side, and at the same speed, through it. Exciting is an understatement…

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Constructed in just 110 days in 1922, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza was the world’s third purpose-built race track, coming after Brooklands in the UK and Indianapolis in the US. Like
                those two tracks, the original circuit featured a daunting series of banked curves, as well as much of the ‘outfield’ section that’s still in use today.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Monza opened its doors on September 3 1922, just a week before it hosted that year’s Italian Grand Prix. It was then part of the original Formula 1 calendar in 1950, and has held the
                Italian Grand Prix every year bar one since.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Rapido! Formula 1’s fastest ever lap was set at Monza – Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya’s 260.6km/h effort during practice for the 2004 Grand Prix – which should give you some idea
                of the nature of the track the locals call ‘La Pista Magica’. Cars are on full throttle for 80% of the lap, and hit their Vmax on the circuit’s 1.1km start/finish straight. From there,
                they roar off into the historic park section, where a series of big stops into tight chicanes give the brakes a good workout.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The parkland setting of Monza, located just to the north east of Italy’s fashion capital Milan, makes for a relaxed, leafy setting for a Grand Prix, while the preserved Monza banking –
                spot it in the background as the cars exit the Parabolica, as well as on the flyover bridge they pass under en route to the Variante Ascari – leaves you in no doubt that you’re in the
                presence of a very special race track.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Aim for the grandstand at the Variante del Rettifilo to witness the awesome spectacle of cars braking from around 350km/h to just 70km/h before negotiating the tight chicane. This is
                also one of the track’s best overtaking spots, as well as a magnet for first-lap tussles.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">It wasn’t – Baku is the newest street circuit on the Formula 1 calendar, joining the ranks of Monaco, Melbourne and Singapore.</div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The first Grand Prix in Baku was held in 2016, as the European Grand Prix. That was followed by the inaugural Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, which witnessed one of the biggest upsets
                of the season, with Daniel Ricciardo winning out from Valtteri Bottas and the Williams of Lance Stroll, while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel engaged in some argy-bargy behind the
                Safety Car.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A mixture of wide and open and tight and twisty. The lonnnnng main straight along the Baku shoreline is a slipstreaming mecca, and with cars able to run three abreast into Turn 1, the
                action often looks more IndyCar than F1. However from there, the track loops around into the city’s narrow, winding Icheri Sheher old town, dramatically wending past Baku’s medieval
                city walls. As in Monaco, slightest mistakes are punished quickly and severely, while set-up wise, the teams are forced to choose between downforce for the twisty bits and less drag
                for the straight.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                As with all city tracks, spectating at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix means that you’re right in the middle of the action when the cars get put back in their boxes. Baku itself is a buzzing
                city, while food is a key part of Azerbaijan’s culture, incorporating elements of Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine – so eat up!
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The principal Absheron grandstand at the end of the main straight should be high up on your viewing wish-list, as you’ll be watching the cars braking from around 350km/h into the
                90-degree Turn 1 – and you’ll likely get to watch the lion’s share of overtaking too. Elsewhere, the Icheri Sheher grandstand provides a unique vantage point, as you watch the cars
                wriggle through the city gate section and power on down to the super-fast Turn 13-15 complex.

                The Marina Bay Circuit arrived on the scene in 2008. A street track with the city's famous skyline as its spectacular backdrop, the initial circuit plan by Herman Tilke was refined by
                KBR Inc, while the event has quickly established itself as one of the standouts on the F1 calendar.

              <div class="answer">
                In 2008, Singapore had the honour of hosting the first night-time race in F1 history. The Grand Prix – the 15th round of that season – proved a huge hit with the teams and drivers,
                while Renault’s Fernando Alonso claimed a controversial victory.

              <div class="answer">
                The Marina Bay Circuit is one of the most physically demanding on the calendar, its bumpy street surface coupled with humid conditions giving the drivers plenty to think about. Even
                after a 2023 layout change reducing the number of corners from 23 to 19, they are working the wheel a lot, too, around the high-speed lap – the physical stress causing them to lose as
                much as 3kg in body weight over the course of a race.

                make a pilgrimage to the famous Raffles Hotel – the proper home of the Singapore Sling (non-alcoholic versions are available!)

                and 3. You’ll get a great view of the start too – expect to see plenty of sparks fly as the drivers blast off the line.

              <div class="answer">
                The Circuit of The Americas, designed by Hermann Tilke in collaboration with American architectural firm HKS, endured something of a nervy start, with construction suffering several
                setbacks. It was well worth the wait, though, when 1978 F1 champion Mario andretti opened the track on October 21 2012.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                F1 first raced at the Circuit of The Americas in 2012, for the first United States Grand Prix since the 2007 race at Indianapolis. Unsurprisingly, over 100,000 spectators packed out
                the Austin venue, witnessing Lewis Hamilton’s last ever win in a McLaren before his switch to Mercedes for 2013.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                If the corners at COTA seem familiar, they should be. Turns 3 through 6 look not dissimilar to Silverstone's high-speed run through Maggotts/Becketts or the S Curves at Suzuka, while
                Turns 12 through 15 mimic Hockenheim's stadium section. Meanwhile, the uphill run into wide, wide Turn 1 – hey, everything’s bigger in Texas, right? – has provided some fine overtaking
                action in the track’s short life.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                There’s a reason Austin is often regarded as America’s coolest city, with great food and a vibrant nightlife, all united under the banner of the city’s unofficial slogan: ‘Keep Austin
                Weird’. Then when racing starts, you’ll be in attendance at one of the great modern race tracks. With the Americans’ attitude to partying, you won’t want to miss out!
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                You’re spoilt for choice. If you sit in the main grandstand on the start-finish straight you’ll get – in true US style – the benefit of an in-seat food and drinks service, while those
                in the stand at Turn 1 enjoy a view all the way to downtown Austin. But if you want to see the racing action up close, find a way into the the Stadium Section stands at Turns 15/16.

              <div class="answer">
                In 1959. The father of Mexico’s most famous racing brothers, Ricardo and Pedro Rodriguez, was an advisor to Mexican President Adolfo Lopez Mateo, and had a word in his boss’s ear about
                building a racing circuit in Mexico City’s Magdalena Mixiuhca sports park using the existing internal roads. El Presidente liked the idea, and work on the track was completed in under
                a year.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Formula 1 cars arrived in 1962 for a non-championship race, returning the following year for a proper, bona fide Grand Prix. That 1963 race was won by Jim Clark, while for the next few
                years, Mexico’s fiesta vibes meant it became the traditional season-ender for Formula 1. Mexico was welcomed back onto the F1 calendar in 2015.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                High up! The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits over 2km above sea level, making the 4.3km lap a breathless experience. The track still largely follows the outline of the original 1959
                circuit, the main difference being that the spectacular – and spectacularly scary – Peralta corner is now bisected, with the circuit instead winding through the old Foro Sol baseball
                stadium, providing one F1’s most unique vistas.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Mexico City is one of the world’s most buzzing, vibrant metropolises. And with the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez located just to the east of the city, with a metro station ready to whip
                you into the downtown at the end of each day’s racing action, the Mexican Grand Prix is a fantastic chance to properly mix sport and culture.

              <div class="answer">
                Fight tooth and nail for a spot in the Foro Sol. Not only will you get to peer down into the cockpits of the drivers as they pass through the stadium, but the atmosphere when the
                podium ceremony unfolds there has to be experienced to be believed.

              <div class="answer">
                Building work began on what ended up being called the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace – but what is more commonly referred to as Interlagos – all the way back in 1938. The track designers
                took their inspiration from three main circuits: Brooklands in the UK, Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and Montlhery in France.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Buoyed by the success of Brazil’s Emerson Fittipaldi, Formula 1 first jetted into Interlagos for a world championship race in 1973. Fans were treated to a home win in the first three
                Brazilian Grands Prix, with Fittipaldi victorious in 1973 and 1974, while Carlos Pace won in 1975.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Like many pre-World War II tracks, Interlagos features banked corners, with the drivers beginning their lap on a sort of half oval – in fact, between 1957 and the track’s return to the
                F1 calendar in 1990, Interlagos could be run as a giant oval. After wiggling through the Senna S and down to Turn 4, the drivers then go through a snaking in-field section with some
                challenging camber changes, before slinging back up the hill and through the banked final turn.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A carnival atmosphere really does dominate in Brazil, and watching Formula 1 cars alongside the locals is something every F1 fan should experience. True, it doesn’t look like there’ll
                be a local driver to cheer on any time soon, but that won’t stop the party at Interlagos.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Because of the bowl-like nature of the track, a place in Grandstand A on the banked entry to the start-finish straight will give you a double whammy of views, allowing you to see the
                cars winding through the infield section and then passing underneath you. On the other end of the straight, Grandstand M will put you on top of the first corner and the Senna S, the
                best spot to watch overtakes on the track.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The 2023 Formula 1 season saw drivers tackle an all-new circuit in Las Vegas, encompassing the very best the City of Lights has to offer – including the famous Strip.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Las Vegas previously staged two F1 races – under the Caesars Palace Grand Prix moniker – in 1981 and 1982. It played host to the season finale on both occasions, with Williams driver
                Alan Jones winning the 1981 race and Michele Alboreto taking his maiden F1 victory for Tyrrell at the 1982 encounter. Meanwhile, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg clinched the title in
                ’81 and ’82 respectively with fifth-place finishes.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Located in the heart of Las Vegas, the new 6.2km, 17-turn street circuit winds its way past iconic locations like Caesars Palace, the Bellagio and the Venetian. With average speeds
                similar to Monza, otherwise known as F1’s ‘Temple of Speed’, fans are guaranteed plenty of action and overtaking.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                There continues to be a huge buzz around the Las Vegas Grand Prix, fuelled by 2023's spectacular inaugural event that gave drivers and fans a taste for more. With the party atmosphere
                the resort city is famous for, a Saturday night race under the lights and entertainment off track to match the action on it, this is one of the events to attend on the Formula 1
                calendar.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A host of ticketing options are available for the Las Vegas weekend, ranging from VIP packages to grandstand seating and general admission. But whatever you go for, a spectacular
                experience awaits – as cars blast around a high-speed circuit set against one of the most vibrant backdrops F1 has ever seen.

              <div class="answer">
                The Lusail International Circuit, located on the outskirts of the capital city of Doha, was built in preparation for hosting Qatar’s first ever MotoGP event in 2004, with the circuit
                completed in just over a year.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                2021 represented the first time Qatar had ever hosted the FIA Formula One World Championship – with the country signing an additional 10-year deal to host the sport from 2023.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Designed primarily with motorcycle racing in mind, the 5.4-kilometre Lusail International Circuit is a fast and flowing track, where medium- and high-speed corners predominate. Over
                one kilometre of the track’s total length is made up of the main straight, which provides plenty of overtaking opportunities into Turn 1.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                If you live in the northern hemisphere and the thought of escaping colder climes in October appeals, you’ll be well catered for in Qatar, with average temperatures around 28 degrees
                Celsius at that time of year. Unsurprisingly with that kind of weather, Qatar is a great country for outdoor pursuits, be that karting at Lusail itself, or trips into the desert to go
                sandboarding, camel riding and 4x4ing.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The Main Grandstand puts you at the heart of the action, with panoramic views of the start-finish straight, the pit lane and the team garages. Meanwhile, the T2 Grandstand offers
                outstanding vantage points to enjoy the action through the circuit’s opening corners.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In 2006, plans were announced to develop Yas Island, located just to the east of Abu Dhabi, into a new tourist destination, with a major part of the plans centring around a 5.5km race
                track. The diggers rolled into what would become the Yas Marina Circuit in May 2007, with the project completed by October 2009.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In 2009. The track debuted as that year’s Formula 1 season finale, with Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel winning from team mate Mark Webber and the already-crowned 2009 champion Jenson
                Button. Vettel would go on to secure his first title in Abu Dhabi a year later, amid much crying.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The Hermann Tilke-designed track is dominated by its 1.2km straight between Turns 5 and 6 – which, with slow-speed corners marking its beginning and end, makes it a honeypot for
                overtaking moves. Other highlights include the tricky run through Turns 10 and 11 into 12, which forces the drivers to brake hard with bags of lateral load still on the car. Track
                modifications ahead of the 2021 race, shortening the lap slightly to 5.28km, have only added to its excitement.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Yas Island was a blank canvas for developers to turn into a tourist attraction, and 11 years and $40 billion later, they’ve nearly finished doing just that. Seven hotels, Ferrari’s
                indoor theme park, a mall, a water park, a golf course, a beach, a concert arena and a nightclub, all framed by perfect Emirati weather. What more could you want?
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Assuming you can’t get a room with a trackside view in the spectacular whale-shaped Yas Hotel – or a berth in a boat’s cabin in the marina – opt for a spot in the West Grandstand, a
                great place to watch all the overtaking action into Turn 6. Or if you’re more there for the atmos, stick yourself in the Main Grandstand overlooking the start-finish straight and enjoy
                Abu Dhabi’s famed pyrotechnics. It might be worth trying to get a seat high up in whatever grandstand you choose, though, if you’re looking to keep out of the sun.
