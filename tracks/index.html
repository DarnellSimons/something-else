              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Ground was broken for the Bahrain International Circuit in December 2002. Like the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, the developers had a blank, sandy canvas to work with, and with that
                fashioned the technical, 5.4km track designed by Hermann Tilke.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                It was 2004 when the drivers first lined up under an unusually cloudy sky for the inaugural Bahrain Grand Prix. The race was dominated (like many in 2004) by the two Ferraris, with
                Michael Schumacher winning out from Rubens Barrichello, while the crowds were also treated to a fantastic dog-fight between the Jaguar of Mark Webber and the Renault of Fernando
                Alonso.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                You can usually expect great racing and decent amounts of overtaking in Bahrain, while the drivers have to contend with wind, racing under floodlights and the difficulty of finding a
                decent set-up with the wide temperature fluctuations between sessions. The track’s most challenging point is the tight, downhill, off-camber Turn 10 left-hander, while the fast run
                through Turn 12 is another highlight, allowing the racers to really feel their cars coming alive.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Given the nature of the track, race-goers in Bahrain have always got a decent chance of being treated to a 'duel in the desert' or three. Away from the race track, Bahrain, as you
                might expect, is a great place to catch some rays, with the 33-island archipelago kingdom featuring some jaw-dropping resorts. And if you want to do some racing yourself, the Bahrain
                International Karting Circuit, located right next to the track, is one of the world’s top karting facilities.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Your options are slightly limited in Bahrain, given that the organisers understandably don’t want loads of fans having to traipse out into the middle of a hot desert to watch the
                action! We reckon your best bet is to get a place in the Batelco grandstand, giving you a great view of cars charging into Turn 8, hammering through 9 and 10 and then passing you on
                the run down to the short-apex Turn 11. Otherwise, the grandstand on the outside of Turns 1 and 2 will allow you to watch overtaking aplenty on either track layout.

              <div class="answer">
                The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is, you won’t be surprised to hear, a temporary street circuit (albeit adorned with some permanent sections), located on the Corniche – a 30km coastal
                resort area of the ancient Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Designed by the Tilke company, in conjunction with Formula 1’s own Motorsports team – who used Google Earth for their initial
                investigations into potential layouts – F1’s Ross Brawn said of the track: “What we want to see is a race circuit. We don’t want Mickey Mouse circuits. We don’t want those old classic
                street circuits with 90 degree turns. We want fast sweeping circuits, circuits which are going to challenge the drivers – and they are going to love it.”

              <div class="answer">
                Fast. Very fast. Average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are around 250km/h – quicker than those at Silverstone, and second on the 2021 calendar only to Monza – aka ‘The
                Temple of Speed’. It is, quite simply, the fastest street circuit ever seen in Formula 1 – while the track also features the most corners on the calendar with 27, many of them quick,
                sinuous bends as the drivers wend their way along the Jeddah waterfront.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix promises a sun-soaked festival of Formula 1, located on an idyllic stretch of the Kingdom’s coastline. The on-track action is stunning, as the drivers get
                to grips with this rapid street track, while Jeddah itself comes alive as the city revels in hosting the F1 circus.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are such that any grandstand provides a spectacular viewing location. Nonetheless, the gladiatorial splendour of the grandstand
                surrounding the banked Turn 13 corner makes for a very special spot for F1 fans.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The deal to host Formula 1 in Melbourne was done in 1993, with the decision taken to create a circuit using a mixture of the existing roads around the city’s Albert Park – mainly
                Aughtie Drive and Lakeside Drive if you fancy driving it yourself – with a little detour through the Lakeside Stadium’s car park.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Just four months after Adelaide held its last Australian Grand Prix at the end of 1995, the Formula 1 teams were back in Australia for Melbourne's first Grand Prix at the start of
                1996. That race is most often remembered for Martin Brundle’s infamous Jordan crash at Turn 3 after he launched himself off the back of Johnny Herbert’s Sauber.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                As a temporary facility, Albert Park can be quite bumpy, while the circuit at the start of the weekend is often slippery, rubbering in as the sessions progress. It’s also a circuit
                that requires a well-sorted chassis, with several spots on the track where the drivers require a reactive front end to allow them to chuck it into a corner. Melbourne is also one of
                the faster tracks on the calendar, with Max Verstappen’s 2023 pole lap set at an average of over 250km/h.

              <div class="answer">
                Often found on lists of the world’s best cities, Melbourne is a blast all year round – and it only gets better when Formula 1 rolls into town. There are bars and restaurants aplenty,
                you’re right by the beach, while the race’s appearance at the start of Australia’s autumn means the temperatures should be peachy.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                If you want to get in a grandstand, opt for either the Waite stand overlooking Turn 10, or the Brabham Grandstand on the outside of Turn 2 to watch cars jostling for position through
                the first chicane. Alternatively, there are some nice general admission spots on the far side of the lake – go for either between Turns 8-9 or 9-10 if you fancy some F1 picnic feels.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In 1962. Soichiro Honda, whose car company you may have heard of, was a man with big ambitions. Seeking to turn Honda into an automotive powerhouse, he decided his company should have
                its own test track. Dutchman John Hugenholtz got the nod, and drew up the now-iconic ‘crossover’ Suzuka track – although original drawings saw the track pass over and under itself a
                full three times, which would have been sweet!
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Despite most people agreeing that Suzuka is a worthy successor to sliced bread in the ‘Best Thing’ stakes, the Japanese track was a relative latecomer to the F1 calendar, making its
                first appearance in 1987. Nigel Mansell would remember that weekend well, after he suffered a crash in qualifying that ruled him out of the race, gifting that year’s championship to
                his bitter rival Nelson Piquet.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Show us a racing a driver who doesn’t love Suzuka, and we’ll show you a liar. The high-speed track remains one of the ultimate driving challenges, with the snaking ‘S’ Curves, the two
                commitment-rewarding Degners and the white-knuckle ride of 130R all highlights in a series of highlights at what is one of F1’s seminal tracks. And hey, it’s got a crossover, which is
                always cool, right?
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                A track that has witnessed an unfair share of legendary F1 moments (not least between Messrs Prost and Senna), a unique set of fans with an unabashed commitment to playing Formula 1
                dress-up, a Ferris wheel, and great food. Okay, for most of us it’s a long slog to get there, but surely a better question is: ‘Why not go?’
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Take your pick. Grandstands D and E overlook the ‘S’ Curves, giving you an amazing chance to watch downforce and commitment working in perfect harmony as the drivers negotiate the
                sinuous turns. Elsewhere, the left flank of Grandstand G places you at the inside of 130R, which should be a bit of a treat, while if it’s overtaking you want, Grandstand I will give
                you a view of the incident-attracting Hairpin.

              <div class="question">When was the track built?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                In April 2003, a marshland in the Jiading District of Shanghai was earmarked for Formula 1 greatness. Eighteen months and around $450 million later, the state-of-the-art Shanghai
                International Circuit was complete.
              </div>
              <div class="question">When was its first Grand Prix?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The 2004 season featured two new races, one of which was the Chinese Grand Prix (the other was Bahrain). If either were added to try and stop Ferrari from winning everything, however,
                it didn’t work – Michael Schumacher won in Bahrain, while Rubens Barrichello triumphed in China.
              </div>
              <div class="question">What’s the circuit like?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                The circuit’s pleasing form when seen from the air – it’s designed to look like the Chinese symbol for ‘shang’, meaning upwards – is equally pleasing to the drivers on terra firma.
                There’s a unique start to the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and 4. The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by
                the drivers, while the circuit also features one of the longest straights on the calendar, the 1.2km stretch that separates Turns 13-14.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Why go?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                Shanghai has expanded itself into one of the world’s most dynamic and lively cities since the start of the millennium, making it an awesome F1 tourist stop. The sprawling Pudong
                district is chock full of hip bars and amazing restaurants. Then when it’s time to go racing, just hop on the Shanghai Metro’s Line 11 and get off at the Shanghai Circuit stop 60
                minutes later.
              </div>
              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                We’re going to recommend Grandstand K, overlooking the Turn 14-15 hairpin, where you’ll be in the best seats to watch all the overtaking. Alternatively, head for Turn 6, the track’s
                other best passing spot, where Daniel Ricciardo sealed his 2018 win with a brave move on Valtteri Bottas.

                Having made its F1 debut in May 2022, the Miami International Autodrome is a temporary circuit, but one designed to have a permanent feel. Set in the Hard Rock Stadium complex in Miami
                Gardens, home to the NFL’s famous Miami Dolphins franchise, the track is the culmination of a development process that simulated no less than 36 different layouts before settling on a
                thrilling, 19-turn lap that provides a street circuit vibe, not dissimilar to Melbourne’s Albert Park.

                are elevation changes too, the main one found between Turns 13 and 16, with the track heading over an exit ramp and under various flyovers across uneven ground. The Turn 14-15 chicane,
                meanwhile, has an uphill approach, with a crest in the middle, and then drops down on exit.

                The Hard Rock Stadium knows how to put on a show – it has hosted six Super Bowls, two Baseball World Series and numerous rock concerts. Put it at the heart of a track designed to
                encourage close racing while meeting the highest safety standards and you have a sure-fire winner for spectators. Then there’s Miami itself – famed for its sandy beaches, art deco
                vibe, vibrant multiculturalism and rich sporting heritage, it’s an essential destination for those visiting the Sunshine State.

              <div class="question">Where is the best place to watch?</div>
              <div class="answer">
                When viewing a sporting event in a purpose-built stadium, it’s hard to go wrong. In fact, you could walk around the top deck of the Hard Rock Stadium and see every corner of the track
                – pretty unique. As for the best passing spots, a seat near Turns 1, 11 or 17 should put you in the thick of the action.
